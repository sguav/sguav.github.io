Welcome to my blog.

I'm `sguav`, a CPU/RTL designer, embedded system engineer, and tinkerer.

What I am interested in and I might publish here:

- CPU & RTL design
- Bare metal firmware
- Homelabbing experiments
- Hardware

I'll be showing roughly my workflows and productions, but I'm not a teacher unfortunately.

Expect bugs. Expect noise. Or just don't expect anything, it's way better.
